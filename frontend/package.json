    "description": "Welcome to the Multi-Organ Segmentation Transformer repository! Our project introduces a cutting-edge approach to multi-organ segmentation in medical imaging, leveraging transformer-based architectures. Our model, named UNETR (UNet Transformers), employs a transformer as the encoder to capture sequence representations of input volumes and effectively grasp global multi-scale information. This design, inspired by the successful \"U-shaped\" network, ensures accurate delineation of multiple organs from medical images.",
